# Drawing With Fourier Series

This project was made to make draws using the Fourier series given a signal representing the draw ordered points

## Next Steps

<ol>
  <li>Add a function to get the edges of a colored image and transform it in a unordered list of points. </li>
  <li>Add a function to given a unordered list of points return a ordered one. (travelling sallesman problem?) </li>
  <li>Extend the idea to 2d signals. </li>
</ol>
