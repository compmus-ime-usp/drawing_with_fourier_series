# Drawing With Fourier Series

Create drawings by using the Fourier series to approximate a given signal, representing the ordered points of the drawing.

<strong>Matplotlib uses ffmpeg to write a file, so if you want to use the Matplotlib drawer version be sure to add ffmpeg to your path!</strong>

## Next Steps

<ol>
  <li>Add a function to get the edges of a colored image and transform it in a unordered list of points. </li>
  <li>Add a function to given a unordered list of points return a ordered one. (travelling sallesman problem?) </li>
  <li>Extend the idea to 2d signals. </li>
</ol>
