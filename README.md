# Drawing With Fourier Series

Create drawings by using the Fourier series to approximate a given signal, representing the ordered points of the drawing.

<strong>Matplotlib uses ffmpeg to write a file, so if you want to use the Matplotlib drawer version be sure to add ffmpeg to your path!</strong>
